Step 2: Requirement Analysis
Users: Admin, Staff, and Student.
Main Functions: Student registration, course enrollment, fee payment, record updating, and report generation.
Non-Functional Needs: Security, reliability, and an easy-to-use interface.

Step 3: System Design
Draw UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Communication, and Package diagrams.
